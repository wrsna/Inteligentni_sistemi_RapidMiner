Well they didn’t get funded so that’s something. Not necessarily a scam. They aren’t claiming to power the phone, just convert some energy from one form to another. I’m VERY sceptical about the amount of power that they can recycle in real world conditions. If it reaches 5% I’ll be impressed. (Not impressed enough to spend $100 on it, but still impressed.)
