I ordered this one and hope the picture quality will be better than on the Shine Ultra, which is practical but has horrible vignetting. Also you should forget about the webcam nonsense. Most people will plug that in webcam-equipped laptops. Use ressources on optics, i would gladly pay more for better optics and higher resolution.

Also. You should implement a way to autofocus and take picture in one operation instead of two operations (i don’t use processing / flatten as they don’t work for me).
