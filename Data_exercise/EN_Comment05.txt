Trying not to get overly frustrated, but it seems the software is not there yet. Where is the Android app? The Windows app does not allow preview and will not load Gcode, so itâ€™s useless except for updating the firmware. I do not have an iPhone or iPad and do not plan on buying one just to use this engraver.
Right now this thing is USELESS without software! Please let me know how to actually use the features you sold us, or provide me details on how to process a return and full refund.
