Iâ€™m not sure some folks have the right expectations. Delays happen. When I join a campaign, I accept that there is a speculative nature to this. We are taking a small financial gamble in the interests of encouraging entrepreneurs and inventors to get some new stuff over the funding hurdle to get to market. If you think of this as a vending machine where you drop in a few coins and get your product, you are bound to be disappointed. You should go to K-mart for the stuff you need today.
