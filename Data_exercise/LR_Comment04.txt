11 month ago, the Skarp team posted some proper updates about where they are and what still needs to be done.
But they almost never stayed that long (last record was 6 or 8 month) without an updates.
Besides, with the Pandemic, I guess even Skarp team will stay home, or at least should have sore decent time to post some updates.
Really not good behavior from them.
