for the analysis. It of course assumes the cold or hot drink is left on the heat sink plate without any motion, and that the mug or can have a perfectly flat surface, and not a concave bottom, as most do. So in reality, only the outer rim of the container in direct contact with the plate (i.e., minimal surface area), and the air in the concave space. And of course in the real world, the container will be removed for drinking and the hot or cold content volume gradually decreases.
