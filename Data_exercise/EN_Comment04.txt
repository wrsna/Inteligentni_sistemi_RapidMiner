Jason, I suggest reading the Kickstarter campaign page. For some reason Cubiio team is not as active here on Indiegogo as they are on Kickstarter. There are a lot of comments from people right there and Cubiio team is responding to almost every comment. As for now, Android app is waiting for approval and should be live soon.
