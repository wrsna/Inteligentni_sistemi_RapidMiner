Three years later and still you don’t even have the product created. And now, according to your last update, it will be shipping at “best case” two years from now. Damn. I’m a really patient person, but you all really should have known better. If you didn’t have a working product, you shouldn’t have committed to a delivery three years ago. It’s your duty as the creator to be realistic. >.<
