When I backed this campaign, I saw that the estimated time of delivery was Dec 2020, which was moved from Nov 2020. I was hoping that was the only delay and decided to help back this. Now I’m looking at Feb of 2021?? It wouldn’t be so bad if you didn’t already have a successful campaign on Kickstarter. . .I figured you had most of the bugs worked out and in production. So let me ask you, the people that backed your Kickstarter. . .have they gotten anything from you yet?!
