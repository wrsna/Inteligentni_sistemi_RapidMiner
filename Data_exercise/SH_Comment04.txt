It is a shame that Indiegogo does not support us know that we need it. They raised the money, therefore if something happens after that Indiegogo must help us. I understand it if they do not raise the money to make the project. Otherwise indiegogo knew about this and fixed everything so when they have everything the way they wanted, file bankruptcy to steal the money so we cannot have our money back.. SHAME ON YOU INDIEGOGO AND HELL WILL BURN YOU AND SKULLY RATS.
