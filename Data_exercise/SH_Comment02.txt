Ahem… actually… WE raised the money, not IndieGoGo. IGG is simply a platform for creators to post projects and raise money for ideas to come to life. IGG has nothing to do with Skully going bankrupt. The Wellers have everything to do with Skully going bankrupt. Skully did post a genuine project. I wore a prototype, and they wanted to produce this thing. The company was poorly managed and money was squandered on lots of things unrelated to production and development. Shame on Skully, not IGG.
