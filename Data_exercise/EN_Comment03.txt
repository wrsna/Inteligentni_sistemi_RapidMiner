Having received my machine I am dissapointed to say it does not do all that was advertised it would do and I would like to arrange for a return. Firstly it arrived damaged with the door broken.

everytime when i try and start a project it says fails to start as it needs to be initialised. When I try and home the machine it fails to do so. As of yet nothing cut and engraved. software is a mess!
