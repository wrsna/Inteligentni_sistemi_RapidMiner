Okay ? I just baked not quite long and I hope this product meets my expectations and my question is, will you start distribution before this month ends ? Be side I was told by indiegogo that if not sent ? I should request for refund before the month ends and lastly, is there any special case coming with your product aside the carton because we canâ€™t have it stack naked
