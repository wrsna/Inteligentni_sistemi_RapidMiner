There was no working product when this started and that was right here in print. They had a working technical demonstrator which showed proof of concept. That info was here all along for all to read from the very beginning and they never made a secret of it. From day one this was backing a great idea in hopes of a product. Ok, they were overly optimistic on the time line when they started, but that has been re-vamped to a far more realistic window for completion.
