Hi Project Owner Creator. I was a backer a number of your V-Tex shoes last year and am back with my support for this V20 #2052 – the Nite All Black at EUR58 + shipping costs EUR22 (which i think is pretty steep!).

I would like to consider taking up the pair offer of Hello G + Nite at EURO138 so need your advice on how to effect this change of order from my single order of 1 pair Nite to the 2 pairs Hello G + Nite?

How about shipping costs for the 2 pairs? hope it won’t be EUR44 :(
