Hello…. I am having a really hard time understanding how to create a “G code” file. The info in your campaign made it seem so easy to create engraving and cutouts with users casually creating objects with the Cubiio. It seemed like an everyday tool that was accessible to anyone. Now I am left feeling like I need to be a computer programmer and trying to learn various third party apps and converting files from one format to another in order to use this tool. PLEASE HELP!
