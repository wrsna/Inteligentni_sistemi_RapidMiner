I’ve been scammed allot in the past on indiegogo and normally wouldn’t back anyone again.
But I’ve seen amazing reviews in the comments on the previous campaign and I’ve seen you respond to everyone. So I’m willing to take another chance.
Though it’s too bad they won’t come together and having to pay double shipping costs. I hope it’s gonna be worth it.
