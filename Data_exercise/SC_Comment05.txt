SCAM!
These people are scammers! Many people from the last campaign have not received anything, CZUR doesnâ€™t care and was constantly lying to the backers for about a year. Be very careful and have a look at over 5000 comments on their last campaign. They will not answer emails, will make false promises, will loose packages and not are about it at all and will behave like they did everything the right way. Be very careful and consider just burning your money before backing a CZUR project.
