Sam I ordered my Shine Ultra scanner in December of 2019 & have documented the non-delivery plus sent the documentation requested including a letter from the USPS Triborough Division of the Postmaster General. Emma promised me that it would be resent in December of 2020. Why wonâ€™t you help me & the others commenting on the Shine Ultra campaign page asking for help? I just want my scanner. #11215
