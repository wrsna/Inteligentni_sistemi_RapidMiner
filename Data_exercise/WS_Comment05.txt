Yes!!! I was finally able to get the specific pair (Hello G) I wanted. I’m a 1-shoe-for-almostanything type of guy, and I use em till destruction. My current shoe (non-v-tex) from 2012 is at its last ropes, so I’ve been eyeing your shoe campaign for a while now.
Now that I’ve secured a pair, I must ask, are 0.5 increments available? I normally wear a UK 9.5, but because I can’t get that adjustment, I went with a UK 10? If it is available, how would I go about getting that done for my pledge?
